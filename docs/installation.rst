Setup Python Environment
------------------------------

SeisoPi is tested against Python versions 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7.
It can be installed on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X operating systems.
Python distributions, such as Anaconda, are recommended to manage the Python
environment as they already contain (or easily support installation of) many
Python packages (e.g. SciPy, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.) that are
used in the SeismoPi package.  For more information on Python package
dependencies, see :ref:`Dependencies`.
