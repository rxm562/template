SeismoPi Modelling Framework
============================
The framework of performing scenario-based seismic damage and renewal cost analysis using SeismoPi is shown in :numref:`flowchart` 
The steps for estimating probability of failure of pipelines, stochastic damage analysis, renewal cost estimation, and interactive mapping are described in subsequent sections.

Corrosion Modelling
-------------------------
A number of corrosion models exist in the literature that estimate the expected depth of corrosion pit over time. Among these models, the model proposed by Rajani et al. (2000) and that proposed Petersen and Melchers (2012) were developed based on field investigation of corrosion dataset of CI pipelines, and therefore, both are applicable for CI pipes.
