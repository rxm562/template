Overview
=====================

SeismoPi performs seismic damage analysis of water pipelines considering the effect of corrosions in pipeline's seismic performace. Probable seismic damage of buried pipelines is typically estimated based on empirical analyses, where the effects of corrosion deterioration are often neglected. SeismoPi estimates seismic repair rate using extended repair rate guidelines's developed by Mazumder et al. (2020). Improved seismic damage estimation of buried water pipelines needs to consider the effect of corrosion on their seismic performance to assist with the development of an effective and efficient renewal strategy. Seismopi is capable of performing scenario-based seismic damage analysis of complex buried water networks efficiently, identifying critical segments and system connectivity, and estimating the renewal cost.
